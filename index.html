      <h2>Why AI for Kids?</h2>
      <p>
        The world is rapidly shifting toward automation, smart systems, and
        AI-driven solutions. Enrolling your child in our AI Bootcamp gives them
        early access to the skills that will define their generation
        problem-solving, critical thinking, and the power to create. This is not
        just another tech class it is a launchpad into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our bootcamp doesn't just teach kids how to use AI tools — it teaches
        them how to think, solve problems, and create in ways that prepare them
        for tomorrow's opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents today want the best for their children — not just traditional
        academics, but real-world digital skills. That's why this bootcamp is
        the perfect stepping stone to make your child future-ready.
