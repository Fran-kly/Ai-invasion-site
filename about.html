      <h1>About the Bootcamp</h1>
      <p>
        AI Invasion for Kids is a visionary 6-week program crafted to introduce
        children and teenagers aged 10–18 to the power and potential of
        Artificial Intelligence. Through engaging, hands-on experiences,
        participants will discover how AI influences the world around them—from
        the tools they use to the careers they may one day pursue.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To democratize access to AI education and empower the youth with the
        knowledge, skills, and mindset to thrive in a digital future.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        As millennial parents, you understand that the world is changing fast.
        Traditional education alone may not fully prepare our kids for the
        opportunities and challenges ahead. This bootcamp is designed to fill
        that gap by providing early exposure to high-impact technologies in a
        fun, safe, and age-appropriate way.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’re not just teaching tech—we’re shaping creative, critical thinkers
        who are confident using tools that shape tomorrow’s world.
